# PostrMagic Project Investigation Plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup Analysis
- Verify XAMPP configuration (Apache, MySQL, PHP settings)
- Check port configurations and conflicts
- Analyze .htaccess settings and URL rewriting
- Document BASE_URL configuration issues
- Verify PHP extension requirements (especially GD)

## Phase 2: Database Structure Analysis
- Examine SQLite vs MySQL configuration detection
- Document database schema and relationships
- Identify missing or problematic tables
- Check for proper indexing and constraints
- Analyze database connection handling

## Phase 3: Code Architecture Assessment
- Map the application structure (user vs admin components)
- Identify duplicate files between root and /admin directories
- Document the authentication and authorization flow
- Analyze session management and potential locking issues
- Evaluate separation of concerns (MVC pattern adherence)

## Phase 4: Legacy Code Identification
- Search for deprecated PHP functions and patterns
- Identify inconsistent coding styles indicating different development eras
- Document hardcoded values vs. configuration
- Map include/require dependencies between files
- Locate commented-out code blocks (often legacy code)

## Phase 5: Scalability Bottlenecks
- Identify direct database access vs. abstraction layers
- Document resource-intensive operations
- Analyze potential performance bottlenecks
- Check for proper error handling and logging
- Evaluate caching mechanisms (or lack thereof)

## Phase 6: Security Assessment
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Analyze CSRF protection implementation
- Document file upload security measures
- Verify proper input validation and sanitization
- Assess session security implementation

## Phase 7: Comprehensive Report
- Create visual representation of current architecture
- Document data flow
- Map component relationships
- Identify critical scalability limitations
- Document technical debt areas
- Assess refactoring priorities
- Recommend architectural improvements
- Provide staged refactoring approach
- Suggest technology updates
- Document transition strategy to maintain functionality

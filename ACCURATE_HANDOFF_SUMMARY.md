# PostrMagic Project - Accurate Handoff Summary

## Current Environment Status
- Project is set up in XAMPP at `c:\xampp\htdocs\postrmagic\`
- Apache is running on port 8080
- MySQL is running and accessible via phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/ (login: root, no password)
- `.htaccess` file has been fixed with proper `RewriteBase /postrmagic/` setting
- The project is accessible at http://localhost:8080/postrmagic/

## Current Issues
1. **Navigation Links Not Working**: When clicking links in the dashboard, "Not Found" errors occur
   - Root cause: BASE_URL in `includes/dashboard-header.php` is missing the `/postrmagic/` subdirectory
   - Many templates use absolute paths instead of relative paths

2. **PHP GD Extension**: Not enabled in XAMPP's php.ini, required for image processing

3. **Database Configuration**: 
   - Currently using SQLite for local development (auto-detected in config/config.php)
   - Need to set up MySQL database to mirror cPanel production environment

## Project Structure (Based on Direct Code Inspection)
- Main entry: index.php (landing page)
- User dashboard: dashboard.php
- Admin dashboard: admin/dashboard.php
- Shared components in includes/ directory
- Configuration in config/ directory

## Dashboard Structure
- Both user and admin dashboards use includes/dashboard-header.php
- User dashboard (dashboard.php) focuses on user content and events
- Admin dashboard (admin/dashboard.php) focuses on system management
- Settings.php in root is for user account settings
- Settings.php in admin/ is for system-wide settings

## Media Management
- User media: media-library.php in root directory
- Admin media: admin/media.php with admin/media-backend.php

## Database Management
- SQLite used for local development
- MySQL intended for production/cPanel
- Database configuration in config/config.php
- Multiple test scripts for database connection and verification

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix BASE_URL definition in `includes/dashboard-header.php` to include the `/postrmagic/` subdirectory
2. Update absolute path links in templates to use BASE_URL or relative paths
3. Enable the PHP GD extension in XAMPP's php.ini
4. Create MySQL database and import schema/data

## Technical Requirements
- PHP 8.1+ required
- MySQL database for production
- SQLite for local development (auto-detected)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- OpenAI API integration
- File upload capabilities

## Previous Work Completed
- Fixed `.htaccess` file by removing invalid `<Directory>` directive
- Added proper `RewriteRule` for protecting includes directory
- Set `RewriteBase` to `/postrmagic/` for subdirectory URL handling
- Created diagnostic scripts to verify environment and database connection
- Successfully accessed phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/
